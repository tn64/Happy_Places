# Assesment

## Self Assesment

For the most part of the project I was responsible of the Databases along with Salih. I contributed to the databases part with the following activities:

-Search for datasources where we can extract the data from.
-Clean the data with python (pandas) before we export it to our database.
-Connect the Jupyter notebook where we did the claening to our Postgres database.
-Export the tables to our Postgres SQL database after I clean them up.
-Responsible to connect our tables in our database with our jupyter notebook where we created our machine learning models.
-Create a database diagram for our presentation that shows every table, primary and foreign keys.

## Team Assessment

### comunication, protocol, roles.

First of all, during the project our team work was splited with the following activities for each person.

Databases: Salih and Jose
Machine Learning: Thomas and Italia
Readme and dashboard: Henry

### challenges
1.- Finding the right data sources for the project. 

2.- Connect our python jupyter notebook codes to our AWS databaes.

Both of the challenge were resolved by asking for help to teacher assistants and doing a research on internet.

### strengths as a team

1.- Every one focusing on their own work and roles on the project, no one of us was focusing in other tasks where we were not responsible for and that made the teamwork so efficient.

2.- Everyone always open to receive feedback from the other teammates on the tasks that each of us was working on. This way we always found ways to improve our codes.

3.- Always have a good communications and schedule days and times for us to connect and chat at least 4 times per week.

## Summary of Project 

The project is about analyse happiness data from 156 countries around the world by using different programming languages such as python and R to develop machine learning models and SQL to create a clean postgres database where we were able to pull any data we want for our machin learning models and push the results back to our database to later connect postgres with tableau and create a dashboard with our results. 

We explored the following questions:
- Which individual factors are most highly correlated to happiness?
Answer: Life expectancy and GDP

- Does alcohol consumption effect overall happiness?
Answer: there is not correlation between alcohol consumption and happiness

- Using the metrics with the highest correlation, can we run an Unsupervised Machine Learning model to identify clusters?
Answer: Yes, we ran an unsupervised machine learning model and identify 3 clusters. You can visualize the clusters in the following link https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/henry.wang8625/viz/WorksheetFilterbyClass/WorldHappiness3Cluster?publish=yes

-Search for datasources where we can extract the data from.
-Clean the data with python (pandas) before we export it to our database.
-Connect the Jupyther notebook where we did the claening to our Postgres database.
-Export the tables to our Postgres SQL database after I clean them up.
-Responsible to connect our tables in our database with our jupyther notebook where we created our machine learning models.
-Create a database diagram for our presentation that shows every table, primary and foreign keys.

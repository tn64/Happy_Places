# Happy Places

## Project Goal
We are the country that created the happiest place on Earth, but how happy are we as a nation?
Through machine learning, we’d like to explore how each of the factors impact the overall learning process. Also, how would each ML methodological approach take different effects on overall learning scheme. In doing so, we’d may find what US needs to improve overall happiness rank. This may be particularly interesting to those who are seeking public office during future elections.

 In search of becoming one of the happiest countries in the world, we are exploring the following key factors:

- GDP per capita
- Healthy Life Expectancy
- Social support
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity
- Corruption Perception
- Residual error

## Questions We Want to Answer
We want to explore the following questions:
- Which individual factors are most highly correlated to happiness?
- Is it possible to predict which countries will experience the greatest happiness based on the factors in the dataset?
- How can US improve overall happiness?
- How does CCI (Consumer Confidence Index) and CPI (Consumer Price Index) play a part in predicting overall happiness?
- Does legalization of cannibis impact happiness?

## Communication Protocols

Throughout this project we will use the following for group communication
- Slack and Zoom: for messaging and meeting during class sessions
- Coda: for scheduling, polling, and progress tracking
- Discord: for screen sharing and voice calls outside of class sessions

## First Steps
Due to prescence of the pandemic, we have decided to throw out year 2020 and the present year 2021. 
- Cleaned Wolrd Happiness Report Data from 2015 to 2019;
- Looked and removed null values;
- Cleaned CCI, CPI and alcohol databases;
- Loaded additional factor data into database; alcohol loaded in ERD as trial;
## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data Analysis and Machine Learning
Based on the World Happiness Report, the GDP, Family, Life expentancy and freedom seem to directly impact overall happiness of a country while trust and generosity do not. The money is the root of all evil, but without money, it's difficult to accomplish much. The way money impacts happiness is expressed in terms of GDP. Here we run into the problem of US having higher GDP than the world's happiness countries, but rank much lower on happiness score.
